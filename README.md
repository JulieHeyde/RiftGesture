RiftGesture (for DK2)
=====================
An experiment to detect head gestures (nod and headshake) with Oculus Rift and Unity.
Requires Oculus Rift and Unity Pro. This project contains two scenes.

### Test.unity

A test scene to detect gestures. You can tweak DetectNod and DetectHeadshake functions in Frame Synthesis/Rift Gesture/RiftGesture.cs.

### Script Example/Script Example.unity

A simple example to use the gesture detection. For some reason the script messages are written in Japanese. You can edit Script Example/Resources/script.txt.

This project (excluding Oculus SDK) is public domain.
